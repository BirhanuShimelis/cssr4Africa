        Subtle body movement started: PASSED

        The joints used for the subtle body movements are:
            left arm: ["LShoulderPitch", "LShoulderRoll", "LElbowRoll", "LElbowYaw", "LWristYaw"]
            leg: ["HipPitch", "HipRoll", "KneePitch"]
            right hand: ["RHand"]

        Ensure the joint moves to the Home position before starting random movements.
        The values of the home positions are:
